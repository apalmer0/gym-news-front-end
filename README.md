## About

-   At its heart, this project is a very basic app for allowing climbing gyms to
    create news stories for members - these stories can be anything, but the app
    is built such that they can include new rock climbs that have been created
    in the gym recently, allowing their members to stay in touch with the latest
    updates at the gym.

    Currently, a user can create an account and login/logout, create a new gym,
    create a news story for that gym - including one or more climbs - and view
    the news story in a newsfeed.

-   Things I would do with more time:

    -   Refactor my code. Despite setting out to be clearer this time around,
        the code quickly degenerated into a long and hard to follow tangle. The
        first thing I'll do is introduce multiple files to separate tasks.
    -   Improve the way all data is rendered - there are a lot of features built
        into this app that aren't available to the front-end user because of
        some challenges with making the data accessible to them.
    -   Add in some new features: favorites, subscriptions, ascent recording.

## Code

-   This app is written with javascript, ajax, handlebars, html, sass, and css
